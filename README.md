# movie-analysis
The focus of the project is the social impact of movies and TV shows.

I have grown up watching a lot of movies and the fact of the matter is that it has certainly played a role in shaping my personality. So,in the past few years, I was thinking about the importance of societal awareness that certain movie plots carry and the lack of appreciation received by such movies in the mainstream audience.  

**Hence, I am interested in finding out whether movies that tackle social issues/hard-hitting topics get their share of recognition.**

1. The first part is the Data Processing and Analysis using Spark SQL and MapReduce. The flowchart of this process is provided.

The general questions that I am planning to answer are follows:

- Whether the number of socially aware movies have increased across the years with more awareness?
- Do audiences prefer certain themes of movies over others. Are there certain themes thataudience do not want to see on the big screen?
- Do socially aware movies get low budgets and box office collections?

2. The second part is Exploratory data analysis on the data big data combined using PySpark.
